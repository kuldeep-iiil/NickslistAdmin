The losses cost small businesses and consumers alike. A bad customer should never have the last word. As contractors we all know that competition is a good thing. We also know the benefit of working together through trade organizations and other programs. This is where the inspiration came from for BillysList.com, because contractors need a voice too. In this internet driven world customers are able to know almost everything about a potential contractor. The Federal, State and Local Governments regulate and keep tabs on us. Organizations like the BBB and other consumer based rating services provide valuable information to guide someone in selecting a contractor that best fits them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All of this takes place because of a few bad apples. The majority of contractors are good and decent people, but the actions of a few, spread distrust upon all of us. BillysList.com seeks to level the playing field and put contractors at ease with the people they work for. Just as consumers want to know who they are contracting with and what their track record is, business owners also understand that it is better to know.</p>',1,'2013-12-16 21:32:51','2013-12-16 21:32:51'),(2,102,'How It Works','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you login to <strong>BillysList.com</strong> you have the option to either rate/review a customer or search for info on a potential customer.
